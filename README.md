# Crossword Solver #

This is a crossword solver which I did for my Data Structures class in my 2nd year in Istanbul Technical University CE. It reads a **puzzle.txt** file as an input and searches for the words in **searchedwords.txt** file. When it finds the words it generates two more txt files:
1. **foundwordsinfo.txt** which contains the position of the words.
2. **lastversionpuzzle.txt** which contains the crossword puzzle itself when the found words are removed.
